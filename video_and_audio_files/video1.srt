00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,180
My best friend who opened a Boba
shop rejected my logo dried.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,060
I tweeted about it, and it went viral.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,300
Someone got it tattooed.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,380
People asked to get tote bags
and Tshirts of the fish.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,780
So I built my own website,
all in four days.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,700
You know what I fucking.
Love about this video?

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,940
And watch.
The whole thing.

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,260
Took a real negative.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,160
Your friend rejecting.
You and turned it.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,520
Into their biggest positive.
Think about that.
